dont normalize initial distributions
			result = new MapID(seeds, 1.0 );/// seeds.size());
TODO:
=memory efficiency (20G is not enough to run 2-2(30)
test functional restriction in exploration
black light


add efficient RWR baseline

#show #paths explored/added
*goodness measure for backward rw needs to be different
*group the const features
  prefer short paths 
*remove normalization from PRA


2012.2.17
3+2!=5? 
// we don't have support when doing concatenation
// so we use hit to normalize accuracy instead
// let's go one step further to use backward rw of bad nodes

*use this accuracy=sum(good)/sum(selected) to all places?
  it is already done
  >get support for cat

2012.2.16
restrict the types of z nodes?
modify induction?


2012.2.15
make acc method perfect
  look at 2-1, 2-2
  run 3-2
  

2012.2.12
*the accuracies are too optimistic, too few query.bad_
  not much we can do about it... except for the X paths
    

induce z features by accuracy
  -added features are not useful

induce z features by MI

induce z features by micro-gradient

induce z features by macro-gradient
  :( bad performance if gradient is correct 

2012.2.3
threshold based bf induction? (#features is hard to control)


compare micro/macro back prop
#change backward path edge directions?
use Y rws to induce Z<--Y paths

>do 2-1 experiments first, then move to 3-2 

2012.2.3

*one graph, multiple predictions

*dont load explore in PRA
*min_feature_support is renamed to min_feature_hit
*use negative feedback
functional restriction

#cache RW at lexicalized path piece level
#cache RW results, thus avoid loading graphs

2011.6.30
merge the learners?
  LearnerPRA->Learner
  LearnerRank->IFunction

remove irrelevant nodes to save memory?
  public void subSampling(Query q)
  -->MAP evaluation is wrong ... 
  MAP for Test() is ok

2009.6.16 rank function
  should we put it in *ERGragh, ETGraph, or #learner?


2009.6.15 dealing with time first
add time stamp to relations?
  -inefficient?
  -no use for real application?
grow the ER graph?
  -complex process
  +clear
  
  
2009.6.14 graph
major operations on graph
for PRA
 - expand path trees, and get distributions
for PageRank
 - get transition matrix?
 - do multiplication

*decided to unify the graph structures
  * prefer seperating type level and entity level graph for clarity
