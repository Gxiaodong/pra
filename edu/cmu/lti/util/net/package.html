This package contains a Server Framework and related networking utilities, which
provide abstractions on which to build socket-based clients and servers. The
framework is geared towards communications protocols based on simple
request-response behaviors. However, the framework is generic enough that more
complex protocols should also be easy to implement here.

<p/>

Base server "types" are implemented in classes such as {@link
edu.cmu.lti.util.net.Server}, and {@link edu.cmu.lti.util.net.ThreadedServer}. These are
abstract classes. In order to define the functionality or "behavior" of a
server, simply extend one of these base classes.
