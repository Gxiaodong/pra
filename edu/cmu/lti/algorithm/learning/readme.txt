stick to M3rd 
=or wrap all the learners?
	want to wrap by myself, SVM in m3rd has no weight vector

Ni Lao, 2008.6.14	isolate data from learner?

Ni Lao, 2008.6.14	dataSet should load itself?

//it might be an wrong assumption that dataSet should load itself
because all the meta data (e.g. index) created during loading should 
actually go into the model



Ni Lao, 2008.6.13	generalize Instance 
for 
dense/sparse, 
String/int indexed, 
binary/real/category value ??
	//unless for DTree, why categorical feature?
