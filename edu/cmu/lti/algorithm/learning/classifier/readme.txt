should label be int or String?

in newInstance() in Classifier?
do it later,after debuging the code

what happens if there are indentical data instances?
need special care at all?

interception(hit) with a set of constraints, instead of one

multiple hit
	also useful for expolating speed up

*Ni Lao, 2008.6.16	initial debuging


*Ni Lao, 2008.6.14	a traner class	
where to put the data needed to train model?


*Ni Lao, 2008.6.14	multiclass
not just a neusance
need to meet the reality
